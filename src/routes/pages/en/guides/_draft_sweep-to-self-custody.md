## Who is this guide for?

Most users right now are using Nostr with a custodial lightning wallet, like Wallet of Satoshi or Alby. I want you to think about the sats in your wallet right now. Now, think about losing all those sats. If that idea makes you feel uncomfortable or worried, this guide is for you.

We'll cover setting up a self-custodial wallet which will allow you to periodically sweep funds from your custodial wallet for safekeeping.

## Why is self-custody important?

Simply put; not your keys, not your coins. When you leave your sats in a custodial wallet you're accepting some degree of counter-party risk. Imagine if Wallet of Satoshi was somehow hacked. Because they hold all customer funds, a situation like this would mean that your funds would be lost.

Because of this, it's strongly advised that you only keep a small amount of funds in _any_ custodial wallet and self-custody the rest of your bitcoin.

## Ready? Let's go.

This is a beginners guide that doesn't require setting up your own lightning node or doing anything techcnial. Our hack here is to use the Nostr community of Bitcoiners to help you make the swap from sats on the Lightning network to self-custodied sats on the main Bitcoin base chain.

1. First follow this guide to set up a new Bitcoin wallet in [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/docs/create-bitcoin-wallet/). You can also use any other self-custodial wallet.
1. Once you have very carefully saved your seed words (which is what you'll use to restore your wallet if needed), you are ready to find someone to do a swap with.
