# Nostr World Domination

## It all starts with builders

The purpose of this doc is to explore the broad space of ideas around how to increase awareness and adoption of the Nostr protocol. It's my (hopefully non-controversial) assertion that a precondition of broad adoption by end-users is adoption by developers, designer, and others active in building tools, products, and services on Nostr.

A vibrant ecosystem gives potential users many ways to come into contact with Nostr and novel, beautiful, and useful products and services will give users something to "run towards" as [@jack](https://primal.net/jack) put it.

Contributions are very welcome. Ideally, lots of independent projects spin out of this doc.

## So how do we get builders excited?

There has been plenty of work done over the last 15 years on how to bootstrap platforms and marketplaces. I think that we can learn a lot from those efforts. We should also be aware of how we can exploit (in a positive way) human psychology to help Nostr spread among the types of people who will maintain and improve on Nostr's decentralized ideals.

Fundamentally, successful developer platforms are usually driven by well-aligned and adequate financial incentives. If a builder can see a path towards a profitable business, they'll jump through plenty of pain to get there. This is the seed of strong product market fit (PMF).

On the other hand; education, developer tools, and a vibrant & supportive community serve two functions.

-   Awareness: Potential builders are more likely to find Nostr via other builders rather than using a product. This is especially true in the early days.
-   Adoption: A platform which is easy to understand and has great tooling which makes it easy to build will gather more momentum. Another way of looking at this is from the oppostite side, e.g. churn. The faster builders are able to make something real (get value from their efforts), the less likely they are to leave the ecosystem.

# Financial incentives

The bootstrapping problem – more soon...

-   Grants
    -   [Opensats](https://opensats.org)
-   VCs
-   Mid/long term
    -   Can a business live on zaps alone?
    -   Value capture points (or lack thereof)

## Other incentives

-   Ideological

# Education & Content

## design.nostr.how

-   subdomain on nostr.how is just a suggestion – this could be it's own standalone site...
-   design resource and guides
-   forum/community/telegram to help push forward the cutting edge in design for decentralized (interoperable) systems

## dev.nostr.how

-   subdomain on nostr.how is just a suggestion – this could be it's own standalone site...
-   dev resources and guides to help developers and push specific patterns that reinforce decentralization.

## Developer tooling

-   [NDK](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk)
    -   NDK will have it's own docs site soon.
-   [nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools)
-   Other developer libraries, incl. UI component libraries for major frameworks
-   Directory of open source projects
    -   Who is looking for help, on what
    -   Broken down by language, etc.

## App discovery

-   [nostrapp.link](https://nostrapp.link) or something similar: App directory of known nostr projects.

## Content

-   Multi-format: Short-form, long-form, video, audio. All content helps new people find the protocol or think about it in a different way.
-   Platform agnostic: Building only nostr-native content will ensure that we bring zero new people to Nostr. We need content for a variety of platforms; youtube, tiktok, instagram, etc.

# Community & Events

## Conferences

-   nostr.world
-   bitcoin conferences
-   how do we expand beyond ourselves and bitcoin? who else needs Nostr?

## Local meetups

## The watercooler
